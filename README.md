# About me

Hiya!, I'm Lux. Nice to meet ya!

Currently I'm a college student at Windesheim University of Applied Sciences. There I study HBO-ICT. I've also completed a study for Software Development at Deltion College just before my current study.

I've put my specialty in frontend development, focusing on ReactJS, together with TypeScript and Sass. For the rest I also work with C# and I'm in the process of learning Python and Java.

For the rest I'm trying to be as social as I can! Hanging out with people always cheers me up. Music and reading are also things I love.

And coffee, of course! ☕
